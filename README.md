Quickser (QUICK SERialization) is a library for quick and efficient serialization of Java classes.
It is derived from the serialization framework of the JDBM3 project.

Features
========
*   Very fast - often faster than Kryo or protostuff and much faster than usual Java serialization
*   Produces rather compact serialized representation
*   Has minimum external dependencies
*   Very small - just a few classes
